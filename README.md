This is a news app that grabs the news from https://newsapi.org/v2/everything api

The app focuses manly on environmental news. Each navbar element has an embeded search word.

The general search has keywords embeded as well so you can get only envyronmental news. 

When you enter on the page I used https://get.geojs.io/v1/ip/geo.json  to get your location (lat, log, city and state) based on your IP.

The app uses lat and log to generate the local weather using https://api.darksky.net/forecast. 

The app uses your location to generate local news.
